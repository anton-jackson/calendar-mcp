# MCP Server Deployment: Claude Desktop vs macOS App

## Comparison of Deployment Approaches

### Claude Desktop Managed (Recommended for Most Users)

**How it works:**
- Claude Desktop launches and manages the MCP server process
- Server runs only when Claude Desktop is active
- Configuration via `mcp_settings.json`

**Advantages:**
✅ **Simpler setup** - Just add configuration to Claude Desktop
✅ **Automatic lifecycle management** - Claude handles start/stop/restart
✅ **No additional apps** - Uses existing Claude Desktop installation
✅ **Standard MCP pattern** - Follows established MCP server conventions
✅ **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
✅ **Automatic updates** - Server updates with your project updates
✅ **Resource efficient** - Only runs when Claude Desktop is active

**Disadvantages:**
❌ **Tied to Claude Desktop** - Server only available when Claude is running
❌ **Limited GUI management** - No visual interface for calendar configuration
❌ **Command-line configuration** - Calendar sources must be configured via files or API

**Best for:**
- Most users who primarily use Claude Desktop
- Developers and power users comfortable with configuration files
- Cross-platform deployments
- Simple, lightweight installations

### macOS App Managed

**How it works:**
- Standalone macOS app manages the MCP server
- Server can run independently of Claude Desktop
- GUI interface for configuration and management

**Advantages:**
✅ **Independent operation** - Server runs regardless of Claude Desktop status
✅ **GUI management** - Visual interface for adding/removing calendar sources
✅ **System integration** - Launch at login, menu bar status, native macOS experience
✅ **User-friendly** - Non-technical users can manage calendar sources easily
✅ **Always available** - Can serve multiple MCP clients simultaneously
✅ **Visual feedback** - Real-time status indicators and error reporting

**Disadvantages:**
❌ **macOS only** - Limited to Apple platforms
❌ **Additional complexity** - Requires separate app installation and management
❌ **Resource usage** - Runs continuously, consuming system resources
❌ **Maintenance overhead** - Additional app to update and maintain

**Best for:**
- macOS users who want a native app experience
- Non-technical users who prefer GUI management
- Users who want the server always available
- Organizations deploying to macOS-only environments

## Recommended Approach by User Type

### For Developers and Power Users
**→ Claude Desktop Managed**
- Simpler setup and maintenance
- Follows standard MCP patterns
- Easy to version control configuration
- Cross-platform compatibility

### For End Users and Organizations
**→ macOS App (on macOS) + Claude Desktop option**
- Provide both options for flexibility
- macOS app for user-friendly management
- Claude Desktop config for developers

### For Cross-Platform Deployment
**→ Claude Desktop Managed**
- Works on all platforms Claude Desktop supports
- Consistent experience across operating systems
- No platform-specific app development needed

## Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

You can actually support both approaches simultaneously:

### 1. Primary: Claude Desktop Configuration
Provide the standard MCP configuration for most users:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "public-calendar-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/public-calendar-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Optional: macOS App for Enhanced Experience
Offer the macOS app as an optional enhancement that:
- Provides GUI management for calendar sources
- Can still work with Claude Desktop's MCP server instance
- Offers system integration features
- Serves as a management interface rather than the primary server

### 3. Configuration Sharing
Both approaches can share the same configuration files:
- Calendar sources stored in `~/.config/public-calendar-mcp/sources.json`
- Both the Claude Desktop server and macOS app read from the same config
- macOS app provides GUI for editing, Claude Desktop server provides MCP functionality

## Implementation Recommendation

**For your project, I recommend:**

1. **Primary focus: Claude Desktop integration**
   - This is the standard MCP pattern
   - Reaches the widest audience
   - Simplest for users to adopt

2. **Secondary: macOS app as optional enhancement**
   - Position it as a "management companion app"
   - Provides GUI for calendar source management
   - Offers system integration features
   - Can coexist with Claude Desktop MCP server

3. **Documentation strategy:**
   - Lead with Claude Desktop setup in README
   - Mention macOS app as optional enhancement
   - Provide clear setup instructions for both

This approach gives users choice while following MCP best practices and maximizing compatibility.

## Example Documentation Structure

```
README.md
├── Quick Start (Claude Desktop)
├── Advanced Setup (macOS App)
└── Configuration Options

CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONFIG.md (detailed Claude setup)
MACOS_APP_SETUP.md (detailed macOS app setup)
```

This way, you get the benefits of both approaches while maintaining the standard MCP server pattern that most users expect.
