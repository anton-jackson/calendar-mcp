# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for macOS desktop that enables AI agents to search and access public calendar data. The server will provide standardized tools for querying various public calendar sources, along with a simple GUI interface for managing calendar sources. This allows AI agents to find events, check availability, and retrieve calendar information to assist users with scheduling and event discovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to search for public events by date range, so that I can help users discover relevant activities and plan their schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent requests events for a specific date range THEN the system SHALL return a list of public events within that timeframe
2. WHEN the agent provides location parameters THEN the system SHALL filter events by geographic location or venue
3. WHEN the agent specifies event categories THEN the system SHALL return only events matching those categories
4. IF no events are found for the specified criteria THEN the system SHALL return an empty result with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to retrieve detailed information about specific events, so that I can provide comprehensive event details to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent requests details for a specific event ID THEN the system SHALL return complete event information including title, description, date, time, location, and organizer details
2. WHEN event details include recurring information THEN the system SHALL provide recurrence patterns and upcoming instances
3. IF an event ID is invalid or not found THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
4. WHEN event information includes external links THEN the system SHALL provide properly formatted URLs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to search for events by keywords or topics, so that I can find relevant events based on user interests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent provides search keywords THEN the system SHALL search event titles, descriptions, and tags for matching content
2. WHEN multiple keywords are provided THEN the system SHALL support both AND and OR search logic
3. WHEN search results are returned THEN the system SHALL rank results by relevance
4. IF no matching events are found THEN the system SHALL return an empty result with search suggestions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to follow standard MCP protocols, so that it can integrate seamlessly with any MCP-compatible AI system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL implement the standard MCP server interface
2. WHEN tools are requested THEN the system SHALL provide properly formatted tool definitions with JSON schemas
3. WHEN tool calls are made THEN the system SHALL validate input parameters and return structured responses
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standardized MCP error responses

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple GUI interface to manage calendar sources, so that I can easily add or remove public calendars without technical configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the GUI is launched THEN it SHALL display a list of currently configured calendar sources
2. WHEN I click "Add Calendar" THEN the system SHALL provide a form to input calendar details (name, URL, type)
3. WHEN I select a calendar source and click "Remove" THEN the system SHALL remove that source after confirmation
4. WHEN I modify calendar settings THEN the changes SHALL be applied to the MCP server without requiring a restart
5. WHEN calendar sources have connection issues THEN the GUI SHALL display status indicators showing which sources are active or failing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the server to handle multiple calendar sources, so that users can access diverse public calendar data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is configured THEN it SHALL support multiple calendar source integrations including iCal, CalDAV, and Google Calendar public feeds
2. WHEN calendar sources are unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle failures and continue serving available sources
3. WHEN rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN calendar data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL normalize data formats across different sources
5. WHEN the GUI updates calendar sources THEN the server SHALL dynamically reload the configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to check availability for specific time slots, so that I can help users find free time periods around public events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent checks availability for a time range THEN the system SHALL return whether that time conflicts with public events
2. WHEN availability conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide details about conflicting events
3. WHEN checking multiple time slots THEN the system SHALL return availability status for each slot
4. IF location context is provided THEN the system SHALL consider only events in the relevant geographic area

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want the application to integrate well with the macOS desktop environment, so that it feels native and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is installed THEN it SHALL appear in the Applications folder and be launchable from Spotlight
2. WHEN the GUI is displayed THEN it SHALL follow macOS Human Interface Guidelines for appearance and behavior
3. WHEN the server is running THEN it SHALL provide a menu bar indicator showing server status
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL optionally launch at system startup if configured by the user
5. WHEN the application is quit THEN the MCP server SHALL gracefully shut down and clean up resources
